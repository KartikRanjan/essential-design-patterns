## Introduction to Design Patterns

Design patterns are time-tested solutions to common software design problems. They help developers write code that is more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand. Mastering design patterns enables you to communicate ideas clearly and build robust applications.

- Focus on object creation mechanisms.

### 2. Structural Patterns
- Deal with object composition and relationships.
