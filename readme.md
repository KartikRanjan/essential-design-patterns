# Design Patterns in JavaScript & TypeScript

## Introduction to Design Patterns

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They provide a shared language and best practices for structuring code, making it more maintainable, scalable, and understandable. By learning design patterns, developers can write code that is easier to test, extend, and refactor.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are generally categorized into three main types:

### 1. Creational Patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### 2. Structural Patterns
Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Essential Design Patterns Every Developer Should Know

Below are the most important design patterns, categorized by type, with links to their detailed explanations and examples:

### Creational Patterns
- **Factory** ([factory.md](./factory.md))
- **Builder** ([builder.md](./builder.md))
- **Prototype** ([prototype.md](./prototype.md))
- **Singleton** ([singleton.md](./singleton.md))

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** ([adapter.md](./adapter.md))
- **Decorator** ([decorator.md](./decorator.md))
- **Facade** ([facade.md](./facade.md))
- **Module** ([module.md](./module.md))
- **Proxy** ([proxy.md](./proxy.md))
- **Revealing Module** ([revealing-module.md](./revealing-module.md))

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility** ([chain-of-responsibility.md](./chain-of-responsibility.md))
- **Command** ([command.md](./command.md))
- **Middleware** ([middleware.md](./middleware.md))
- **Observer** ([observer.md](./observer.md))
- **State** ([state.md](./state.md))
- **Strategy** ([strategy.md](./strategy.md))
- **Template Method** ([template-method.md](./template-method.md))

### Asynchronous Patterns
- **Promise/Async** ([promise-async.md](./promise-async.md))
