> **A curated collection of the most essential design patterns for modern JavaScript and TypeScript developers.**

---

## 👤 **Who is this for?**

> This collection is designed for **beginner to intermediate developers** who want to understand and apply essential design patterns in JavaScript and TypeScript. If you are new to design patterns or want to strengthen your foundational knowledge, this resource is for you.

## 📚 **Introduction to Design Patterns**

> _Design patterns are time-tested solutions to common software design problems._ They help developers write code that is more **maintainable**, **scalable**, and **easier to understand**. Mastering design patterns enables you to communicate ideas clearly and build robust applications.

---

## 🗂️ **Types of Design Patterns**

Design patterns are generally grouped into the following categories:

- **Creational Patterns**: _Focus on object creation mechanisms._
- **Structural Patterns**: _Deal with object composition and relationships._
- **Behavioral Patterns**: _Concerned with communication between objects and responsibility assignment._
- **Asynchronous Patterns**: _Handle asynchronous operations and flows._
